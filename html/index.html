                <h4>La Pradera Landfill:</h4>
                <p>  The La Pradera sanitary landfill has several waste storage tanks and is currently occupied at 95% of its total capacity. Over several years, its useful life has been extended. The main objective of the previous administration in Medellín was to make the La Piñuela waste storage facility operational; however, it is unclear why the project has not been completed. Currently, work is underway to have the La Piñuela reservoir ready by early 2025. In addition, the current government is making great efforts to keep the Altair basin operational, which faces risks due to movements in the waste mass due to the unstable conditions in which it is located. An area capable of receiving more than 3,500 tons of waste per day, called “La música”, has been adapted; however, it is predicted that the capacity of this facility will be completely exhausted by May of this year.</p>

                <h4> MEDELLIN RIVER: </h4>
                <p>The Medellín River is a hydrographic basin that crosses the entire valley from south to north. It is born in Alto de San Miguel and, when it reaches the height of Barbosa, it changes its name to “Porce River”. This river is an example of how we neglect some of our natural resources, water being one of the most affected. In Medellín, the river's water quality is very poor, classified as ICA Global, and one of the roots of the problem lies in the city's inadequate waste collection. Unfortunately, Medellín lacks sufficient garbage containers. Our project seeks to focus on contributing to initiatives that are concerned with recovering this critical water resource for Medellín.</p>

                <p> <b>Improved security:</b>
                Blockchain technology uses advanced cryptography to secure data and transactions.
        <br><b>Transparency and Traceability:</b>
        Blockchain provides an immutable record of all transactions, improving transparency. 
        <br><b>Innovation and Competitiveness:</b>
        Adopting blockchain can position your business as innovative and at the forefront of technology. 
        <br><b>Compliance and Regulation:</b>
        Blockchain can facilitate regulatory compliance by providing a clear and accessible record of all transactions. This is particularly useful in highly regulated industries such as finance and healthcare.
        <br><b>Crisis Resilience:</b>
        Decentralized blockchain infrastructure can help maintain business continuity even in crisis situations, as it does not rely on a single entity or central server.
